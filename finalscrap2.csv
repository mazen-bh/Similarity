151,Explain The Key Differences Between LocalStorage And SessionStorage Objects.,"The key differences between localStorage and sessionStorage objects are as follows:
The localStorage object stores the data without an expiry date. However, sessionStorage object stores the data for only one session.
In the case of a localStorage object, data will not delete when the browser window closes. However, the data gets deleted if the browser window closes, in the case of sessionStorage objects.
The data in sessionStorage is accessible only in the current window of the browser. But, the data in the localStorage can be shared between multiple windows of the browser."
152,When is it appropriate to use frames,"Frames can make navigating a site much easier. If the main links to the site are located in a frame that appears at the top or along the edge of the browser, the content for those links can be displayed in the remainder of the browser window."

155,What is the hierarchy that is being followed when it comes to style sheets,"If a single selector includes three different style definitions, the definition that is closest to the actual tag takes precedence. Inline style takes priority over embedded style sheets, which takes priority over external style sheets."

157,How are active links different from normal links,"The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link.

158,What are the different tags to separate sections of text,The <br> tag is one way to separate the lines of text. There are other tags like the <p> tag and <blockquote> tag that are also used to separate sections of text.
159,Are there instances where the text will appear outside of the browser,"By default, the text is wrapped to appear within the browser window. However, if the text is part of a table cell with a defined width, the text could extend beyond the browser window."
160,What is the advantage of grouping several checkboxes together,"The checkboxes don‚Äôt affect one another. But, grouping these checkboxes together help to organize them. Checkbox buttons can have their name and do not need to belong to a group. A single web page can have many different groups of checkboxes."
161,What happens if there is no text between the tags Does this affect the display of the HTML file,"If there is no text present between the tags, there is nothing to format. Therefore, no formatting will appear. Some tags, such as the tags without a closing tag like the <img> tag, do not require any text between them."
162,What are the limits of the text field size,"The default size for a text field is around 13 characters. However, if you include the size attribute, you can set the size value to be as low as 1. The maximum size value will be determined by the browser width. Also, if the size attribute is set to 0, the size will be set to the default size of 13 characters."
163,What is the relationship between the border and rule attributes,"Default cell borders, with a thickness of 1 pixel, are automatically added between cells if the border attribute is set to a nonzero value. Similarly, If the border attribute is not included, a default 1-pixel border appears when the rules attribute is added to the <table> tag."
164,What is SVG,"HTML SVG is used to describe the two-dimensional vector and vector or raster graphics. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files.

HTML allows programmer to perform changes in the tags and use attribute minimization whereas XHTML when user need a new markup tag then user can define it
.html is about displaying information whereas XHTML is about describing the information."
169,How many types of CSS can be included in HTML,"There are three ways to include the CSS with HTML:
 Inline CSS: It is used for styling small contexts. To use inline styles add the style attribute in the relevant tag.
External Style Sheet: This is used when the style is applied to many pages. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag. The <link> tag goes inside the head section.
<head>
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
</head>
Internal Style Sheet: It is used when a single document has a unique style. Internal styles sheet needs to put in the head section of an HTML page,"
170,What are logical and physical tags in HTML,"Logical tags are used to tell the meaning of the enclosed text. The example of the logical tag is <strong> </strong> tag. When we enclose the text in the strong tag, it tells the browser that enclosed text is more important than other texts.

File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer
File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls
Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files
Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings.
Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis"

This has a major advantage over straight-up polling. In polling, there is a lot of overhead since every time it is establishing an HTTP connection and tearing it down whereas, in server-sent events, there is one long-lived HTTP connection. To use a server-sent event, <eventsource> element is used. The src attribute of this element specifies the URL from which sends a data stream having the events.<eventsource src = ""/cgi-bin/myfile.cgi"" />"
224,What are Web Workers,"These are added to bring parallelism and async capability. It runs in the background to do the computationally expensive tasks without yielding to make the page responsive. It is achieved by starting a separate thread for such tasks. These are not meant to perform UI operations. There are three types of web workers:Dedicated Workers - These are workers that are utilized by a single script.
Shared Workers -These are workers that are utilized by multiple scripts running in different windows, IFrames, etc.
Service Workers - These act as proxy servers between web applications, the browser, and the network. Mostly used for push notifications and sync APIs."
225,What is the usage of a novalidate attribute for the form tag that is introduced in HTML5,"Its value is a boolean type that indicates whether or not the data being submitted by the form will be validated beforehand. By making this false, forms can be submitted without validation which helps users to resume later also."

Few raster file formats include PNG(.png), JPEG(.jpg), etc.Vector Images - The vector image is defined using algorithms with shape and path definitions that can be used to render the image on-screen written in a similar markup fashion. The file extension is .svg"
227,How to support SVG in old browsers,"To support old browsers instead of defining the resource of svg in src attribute of <img> tag, it should be defined in srcset attribute and in src the fallback png file should be defined.<img src=""circle.png"" alt=""circle"" srcset=""circle.svg"">"
228,What is a manifest file in HTML5,"The manifest file is used to list down resources that can be cached. Browsers use this information to make the web page load faster than the first time. There are 3 sections in the manifest file CACHE Manifest - Files needs to be cached
Network - File never to be cached, always need a network connection.
Fallback - Fallback files in case a page is inaccessible"
229,What is the Geolocation API in HTML5,"Geolocation API is used to share the physical location of the client with websites.
